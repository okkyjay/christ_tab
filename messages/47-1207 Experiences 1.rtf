And I believe that if there ever wa\hich\af29\dbch\af28\loch\f29 s\hich\af29\dbch\af28\loch\f29 
 a time of all the church history, that Voice is now, "Rise, we're going across Jordan now." That's right. The church has been pulled through everything. It's broke up in sects here in the denominations. This is my last words on this. And I tried hard.
